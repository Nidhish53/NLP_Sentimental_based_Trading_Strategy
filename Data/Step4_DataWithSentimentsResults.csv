AAPL|As Apple (AAPL +2.5%) surges above $425, a French site leaks an apparent sales doc for Japanese carrier KDDI that states iPhone 5S pre-sales will start on June 20 (shortly after the WWDC conference) ahead of a July launch. The doc also claims the 5S will have a 13MP camera and fingerprint reader. It's possible the launch info is dated - there have been multiple reports the 5S launch has been pushed back to Aug./Sep. from July. Also: KGI Securities, which has a pretty good track record, reports new MacBook Pro/Air models will arrive at WWDC, and that display yield issues will likely push back retina iPad Mini mass-production to October.
